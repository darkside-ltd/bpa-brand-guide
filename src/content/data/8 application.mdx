## Social Media

### Profile

In the context of a profile image, the primary logo should be optically aligned closer to the top and right of centre. Here, the usual clear space rules donâ€™t apply, and we should look for visual centering of the logo without cropping any part of it.

    <Imag src={img1} alt="Instagram Profile Mockup." aspectRatio="104:100" format="jpg" width={553}/>
</div>


### Stories

Mockups of how the graphic assets and typography can be used to create stories to share on social media.
