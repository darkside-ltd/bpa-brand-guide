Use the shapes to create movement on an otherwise stationary canvas. These examples show the brand in use on tear drop flags and table covers for use at events.

## Social Posts

The social media posts are designed to draw attention to the athletes by centrally aligning them in the canvas, and supporting their position with shapes.

The shapes are designed to focus on the movement of the athletes by highlighting their position, matching their posture, and grounding their stance in the activities they are performing.

For instance, vertically aligned shapes can be used for images where the athletes are vertically filling the canvas. Circular shapes can be used where the athlete is centrally positioned in the canvas. Horizontally aligned shapes can be used in imagery containing multiple athletes moving horizontally across the canvas, or even in landscape imagery.

To maximise the imagery’s impact, the Portrait aspect ratio (4:5/1080x1350px) should be used on all social platforms, where possible.
Some posts don’t need any waves, as per the example to mark the coronation of King Charles.

## Post Blueprint

For images containing no text, the logos must be placed within the safe area, ideally in one of four corners, to give room for the athlete as the subject of the image.

The text box and logo lock-ups are to be placed at either the Header or the Footer of the image to make space for the focal point of the image.

### Post Text Box

For images containing text, we have created a holding box to ensure legibility and prominence on the asset.

Font Sizes:
#### Main Header
90px (5.625em)
#### Sub Header & CTAs
50px (3.125em)
#### Body Text
35px (2.188)em 


The background colour of the text box is to be sampled from the darkest colour immediately behind the box, with a ‘Fill’ value between 70-95%.
