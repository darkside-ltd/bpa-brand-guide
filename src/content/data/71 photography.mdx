## Photography

Let the athletes and sport take centre stage with authentic imagery captured during the height of competition. Imagery should showcase the raw emotion and endeavour required to compete at the highest level in sport.
Team Announcement imagery should bring out the personality of the athletes in a step away from the typical photography associated with selection announcements.

## Non-athlete Photography

Non-athlete photography should always be genuine. Be that people or activities. Ideally we want to convey movement and or community to our demographic. Some motion blur or out of focus elements are okay because movement isn’t staged, it’s messy and real.
