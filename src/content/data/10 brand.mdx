## Brand Essence

We are champions of change in a sporting revolution started by Sir Ludwig Guttman at Stoke Mandeville more than 70 years ago.

Fast forward to the present day and ParalympicsGB is a world leading sports team winning medals across a diverse range of sports to help unite and inspire the nation.

Paralympic athletes are at the heart of everything we do. Authentically showcasing their sporting prowess while also revealing their lived experience as disabled people.

We can be edgy, challenging and playful reflecting the personalities of the athletes that come together to form ParalympicsGB at each Summer and Winter Games.

We believe the success Paralympic athletes achieve on the field of play can be harnessed to deliver real and sustainable change in the lives of disabled people across the UK.

## Vision

Through sport, inspire a better world for disabled people
