Every Body Moves powered by Toyota is the new way to discover inclusive local opportunities to become more active. Our ambition is to create the UK’s biggest community for players, parents and coaches to share their experiences, find useful tips and information on what’s happening near them.

We believe there’s a sport or activity out there for everyone, and we highlight inclusive activities and one-off events for able-bodied and disabled people to enjoy together. Every Body Moves is developed by ParalympicsGB and Toyota to make movement better for everyone.
