Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the founder of the Braille Institute, J. Robert Atkinson, was developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.

Having a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading.
