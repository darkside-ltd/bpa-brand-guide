# Intro

Our mission is to promote inclusivity and accessibility in sports and physical activities, and we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to participate, regardless of their abilities.

We provide a platform for people and organisations to connect and collaborate. Our goal is to create a world where people of all abilities can come together, celebrate their differences, and achieve their goals.

We're committed to inspiring and empowering individuals to pursue their passions and live an active, healthy lifestyle. Through our events, programs, and initiatives, we aim to make sports and physical activities more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

Every Body Moves is a community that values diversity, inclusion, and the transformative power of sports. 

Join us in our mission to create a more inclusive world, where every body can move and thrive.
