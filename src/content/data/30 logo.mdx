## Primary logo: Vertical

### Why we have the ParalympicsGB logo
The ParalympicsGB logo represents our organisation and the team that competes for Great Britain and
Northern Ireland at the Paralympic Summer and Winter
Games. This ParalympicsGB logo should be used for all
public facing use cases.
 
**A: Logo marque**
It is formed by an amalgamation of the flaming Paralympic torch and the traditional British lion to embody British unity and strength. This mark can be used on its own in social media applications.

**B: Word mark**
Simple word mark typeset in Gothic 725 Bd BT and 'GB' in Gothic 725 Blk BT

**C: Agitos**
The logo of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). We are proud to be part of the Paralympic movement. The Agitos should always be connected to the main logo.

##  Clear space and sizing: Vertical

**Clear space:**
For maximum impact, there’s always a fixed amount of clear space around the logo. We use the GB letters from the logotype to define this space, and the exclusion zone scales in proportion to the logo.

**Remember:**
This is just a minimum exclusion zone – where possible, give the logo even more room to breathe.

**Minimum logo size in print**
The PGB logo cannot be used smaller than 25 mm in width.

**Minimum logo size on screen**
The minimum size has been set to 157 pixel.

The logo type has been arranged left.

**C: Agitos**

## Colour Variations

**Full colour**
Ideally the logo should always be on a white background to ensure maximum standout. The full colour logo has the strongest association with the Union flag and should be used wherever possible.

**Black**
The black and white version of the logo can be used when there are printing limitations or the context demands a single colour logo.

**White**
The logo can be used in white on flat colour backgrounds or on top of images. Please ensure sufficient contrast between logo and background colour.
