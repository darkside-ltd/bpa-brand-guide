## Sub Brand

When creating sub-brands and programmes for ParalympicsGB, it's important to maintain some visual consistency with the main brand. This can include using the same brand font, "Atkinson Hyperlegible," which was specifically designed to be highly legible for people with visual impairments. In addition, we recommend using any variation of the colour purple for social impact programs, which is widely recognised as the unofficial colour of disability in the UK.

Using purple as a colour for social impact sub-brands and programs reinforces the association between the brand and disability sports. However, it's important to use the colour appropriately and in a way that complements the overall design of the sub-brand or programme. This may mean using purple as a background colour or incorporating it in other design elements.


## Sub Brand Guide

When it comes to type, we recommend using the brand font for all text elements in sub-brands and programmes, including headlines, body text, and any other text-based elements. This ensures consistency and reinforces the visual identity of the brand.

By following these guidelines for sub-brands and programs, we can create a strong and recognisable visual identity for  ParalympicsGB. This helps to build brand awareness and reinforces the association with the brand.

## Sub Brand Example

The Every Body Moves programme leans heavily into the use of Purple as its primary brand colour. And is repeated throughout the tints and shades on the colour palette to allow designers to create brand assets that work in different mediums.
