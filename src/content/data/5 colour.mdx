Our primary purple pays tribute to the disabled community’s colour of choice. And it expands on the tints and shades available allowing us to subtly inject our primary brand colour into lighter and darker elements. A vibrant accent colour is used to provide interest for decorative elements to an otherwise monochromatic colour scheme.

## Tints and Shades

Primary colours have tints and shades through either end of the spectrum and are designed to be used a base colours for background and foreground elements.

**60-30-10**

To bring the balance into the design, the colours should be combined in the proportion of 60%–30%–10%. 

The biggest part should go to the primary hue, the third of the composition takes secondary colour and 10% percent goes to the colour which helps to make the accents.

## Accent Colour Use

Example use cases for the accent colour.

**Breaking the Rules**

While the accent colour is designed to be used for decorative elements. The tints and shades provided are designed to provide flexibility to maintain accessibility standards.

If for some reason you wanted to use the accent colour where the primary colour is normally used, you still have the palette you need.
