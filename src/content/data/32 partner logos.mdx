## Partner logo lock-up rules

### Our partners
This section give guidance on how to align partner logos. All measurements are to be scaled according to the size of the ParalympicsGB logo. 

Depending on the aspect ratio of the partner logo the construction of the partner lock up changes slightly.

### Square or vertical partner logo
When using a square shaped logo the height or width should be 75% of X.

    <Imag src={img1} alt="Vertical logo sections." format="svg" />
</div>


### Horizontal partner logo
When using a horizontal partner logo the width should not exceed X and the height should not exceed Y.

<div class="frame">
    <Imag src={img2} alt="Vertical clear space guide." format="svg" />
</div>


### Adidas partner logo example
The adidas logo is a horizontal shape but fairly tall at the same time. This means the height should not exceed Y.
